# job-search

Implementation of Adzuna API for Job Searching based on description and location.
This was the first real project built from scratch for the College Project Submission.
Originally it was meant as an API Implementation of GitHub JOBS API but due the suspension of GitHub JOBS, The Adzuna API was used.
The Idea was adapted from Travesty Media YT or Web-Dev-Simplied I can't remember The Video Implemented the API using React & Tailwind CSS. Here we simply went for SSR without any CSS framework.
